# Sandalz
## The Open Source Work-horse project manager designed for CFSY, built for everyone.

#### Project Goal

The end-goal for this project is to create a fully featured enterprise-level resource planning software, tailored for the small tech shop but powerful enough for corporate.

#### What's in a name?

Sandalz's predecessor was the _CFSY Internal Management Program_. Not so catchy, sure, but the program was never going to be public or open-source, so a snappy little name wasn't necessary. Under the hood, the _CFSY Internal Management Program_ was a small gui interface to query our SQL database. The program was written in Ruby, atop the *Shoes GTK GUI* framework. For simplicity, we started calling this program Shoes. When it came time to pick a name, we settled on *_Sandalz_* as a nod to our original management software.

#### Who are we?

Computers for Schools Yukon is the Yukon branch of Computers for Schools. We help to provide tech to students and non-profit organizations in all communities in the Yukon.

#### The CFSY Development Team

The CFSY Development team is the beginning of a code initiative to teach and bring development to the Yukon.
